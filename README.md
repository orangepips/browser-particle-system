# browser-particle-system

Solution for "In-browser Particle System" from http://asymmetrik.com/programming-challenges/

 1. clone repository 
 1. setup http server - simple solution is run the following on a *nix or Mac: `python -m http.server --cgi 8000`
 1. open http://localhost:8000/index.html in a browser. 

Uses [Processing 3](https://processing.org/) to create various animations and [Processing JS](http://processingjs.org/) to render in browser. 

## Commentary 

System is designed to incorporate new processing sketches (.pde files) with a minimum amount of work. 

Put a new sketch into the "sketches/{name}/{name}.pde" directory and add to the JavaScript array `sketches` in index.html. 

It's conceivable to move the sketches entirely into JavaScript via [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) which would open up the opportunity for code reuse between sketches more easily. 

# Problem Description

We are developing a simple side scrolling in-browser game and we need a flexible engine for controlling particle systems. We need you to author a Javascript and HTML-based implementation of a basic 2d engine that can simulate different kinds of particles. Your solution must implement at least two of the following simulation types to demonstrate its extensibility:

 * Snow blowing and falling
 * Rain falling
 * Leaves tumbling down
 * A swarm of insects

We have provided some basic requirements [1] for your solution, so please review these carefully.

## [1] REQUIREMENTS

 * The system should draw a pane that is at least 400Ã—400.
 * You must allow the user to play and pause the simulation.
 * You must allow the user to toggle between two simulation modes (eg. snow vs rain).
 * The solution must be extensible to adding more simulation types.
 * The simulation must be capable of running indefinitely.
 * Be creative and incorporate your own effects and style. Also, there is nothing wrong with leveraging any of the common open source frameworks for building web pages and visualizations.
